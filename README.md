### Welcome to my GitHub Page

This my  first webpage. I will use it to give some key information about me regarding cooking. Indeed I am probably one of the few people I know who does not know how to cook, does not like to cook, but that has been cooking regularly for the last 18 years.   

I started  creating this page about me on Saturday 11 December 2020.

## What food I like the most
1. Brazilian food
2. German food
3. Food with curry

## What I do not like
- I do not like to **cook** 
- I do not my like to cook my **own** food
- I do not like _boring_ people

## What I like to do
- Dance
- Sports
- Work

Hahaha, I will keep this here, so that I do not forget how to code such a framed text

## Sources used when I must cook
[Chefkoch](https://www.chefkoch.de/) is a great source of recipes when I have no idea what to cook. I like to use the search tool by entering the ingredients I have at home. I order the search results based on the scores given by other users (who hopefully know how to cook), and choose one of the best scored recipes.

The person in this picture is not me. Indeed, I would never look that happy when cooking.
