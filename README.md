### Welcome to my GitHub Page

This my  first webpage. I will use it to give some key information about me regarding cooking. Indeed I am probably one of the few people I know who does not know how to cook, does not like to cook, but that has been cooking regularly for the last 18 years.   

I started  creating this page about me on Saturday 11 December 2020.

## What I like to do
- Dance
- Do sports
- Work

## What food I like the most
1. Brazilian food
2. German food
3. Food with curry

## What I do not like
- I do not like to **cook** 
- I do not my like to cook my **own** food
- I do not like _boring_ people

```markdown
Hahaha, I will keep this here, so that I do not forget how to code such a framed text  
```
## Sources used when I must cook
[Chefkoch](https://www.chefkoch.de/) is a great source that I use when I have no idea what to cook.

The person in this picture is not me. Indeed, I would never look that happy when cooking.
