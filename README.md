### Welcome to my GitHub Page

This my  first webpage. I will use it to give some key information about me regarding cooking. Indeed I am probably one of the few people I know who does not know how to cook, does not like to cook, but that has been cooking regularly for the last 18 years.   

I started creating this page about me on Saturday 11 December 2020 during my first ever class on how to program a webpage. Github is only one of the nice tools I learned about today.

The secrets of cooking edible food despite lack of interest and knowledge sounded like an interesting theme to discuss. I am sure  

# What food I like the most
1. Freshly cooked food
2. Brazilian food
3. German food
4. Foods with curry and/or coconut milk

# What I do not like
- I do not like to **cook** 
- I do not my like to cook my **own** food
- I do not like _boring_ people, but this is another aspect

# What I like to do
- Dance
- Sports
- Learn new things, apart from cooking
- Baking

Hahaha, I will keep this here, so that I do not forget how to code such a framed text

# Sources used when I must cook
[Chefkoch](https://www.chefkoch.de/) is a great source of recipes when I have no idea what to cook. I like to use the search tool by entering the ingredients I have at home. Then I order the search results based on the scores given by other users (who hopefully know how to cook), and choose one of the best scored recipes.

The person in the picture is not me. Indeed, I would never look that happy when cooking.
